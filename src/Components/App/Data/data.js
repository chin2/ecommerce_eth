Argentine forces had invaded the Falkland Islands. Britain needed an answer. And fast.\n\nThe idea was simple: to destroy the vital landing strip at Port Stanley. The reality was more complicated. The only aircraft that could possibly do the job was three months from being scrapped, and the distance it had to travel was four thousand miles beyond its maximum range. It would take fifteen Victor tankers and seventeen separate in-flight refuellings to get one Avro Vulcan B2 over the target, and give its crew any chance of coming back alive.\n\nYet less than a month later, a formation of elderly British jets launched from a remote island airbase to carry out the longest-range air attack in history. At its head was a single aircraft, six men, and twenty-one thousand-pound bombs, facing the hornet�s nest of modern weaponry defending the Argentine forces on the Falkland Islands. There would be no second chances . .",

But it was his contemporaries, the Grace twins Myles and Chloe, who most fascinated Max.

      "description": "Jeyamohan, one of the most significant and trend-setting Tamil writers of the present era, announced his arrival in the field of serious and sophisticated writing by his, what is now hailed as his magnum opus by discerning critics, � Vishnupuram�. Conceived as a non-linear fiction, where events are projected in a cyclic order, synchronizing with the concept of history in the Indian cultural tradition, this novel explores the multi[le layers of meaning and substance in the three primary cosmic principles of creation, preservation and annihilation. It is a novel of epic dimension crafted in an innovative style. �Aram� (�Righteuousness�) is a collection of twelve long short stories, thematically linked with the title. In this era of ethical relativism, the philosophical issues such as which is absolutely good and which is absolutely bad may seem apparently irrelevant. But, yet, righteousness as an intrinsic trait of an individual(such rare specimens who are not yet wanting) does not fail to find expression in the form of indignation, compassion, infinite perseverance, capacity for suffering, sense of beauty for its own sake, humanism,, gratitude and world vision. Like� the quality of mercy�, it affects both, the one who has this trait and the one who is provoked to narrate his/her story and in this case the writer himself who has this existential dilemma of reconciling between romantic idealism and the practical worldly outlook. . . The author mentions this in his afterword. I feel he should have included the reader also. After finishing reading this book ,I felt that one cannot write off humanity as yet! All the twelve stories are written based on real characters, the sequential narration of events are fictionalized with nuanced skill to add aesthetic charm and literary elegance.",

Detective Sergeant Manon Bradshaw tries to sleep after yet another soul-destroying Internet date - the low murmuring of her police radio her only solace. Over the airwaves come reports of a missing woman - door ajar, keys and phone left behind, a spatter of blood on the kitchen floor.

And as soon as she sees a picture of Edith Hind, a Cambridge post-graduate from a well-connected family, she knows this case will be big. Is Edith alive or dead? Was her `complex love life' at the heart of her disappearance, as a senior officer tells the increasingly hungry press? And when a body is found, is it the end or only the beginning?",

      "description": "New York, 1939. Tom Bradshaw is arrested for first degree murder. He stands accused of killing his brother. When Sefton Jelks, a top Manhattan lawyer, offers his services for nothing, penniless Tom has little choice but to accept his assurance of a lighter sentence. After Tom is tried, found guilty and sentenced, Jelks disappears, and the only way for him to prove his innocence would be to reveal his true identity - something that he has sworn never to do in order to protect the woman he loves. Meanwhile, the young woman in question travels to New York, leaving their son behind in England, having decided she'll do whatever it takes to find the man she was to marry - unwilling to believe that he died at sea. The only proof she has is a letter. A letter that has remained unopened on a mantelpiece in Bristol for over a year. Jeffrey Archer continues the saga of The Clifton Chronicles with this epic second novel in the series, The Sins of the Father. Family loyalties are stretched to their limits as secrets unravel, and the story moves from the backstreets of Bristol to the boardrooms of Manhattan.",

This book is not about any philosophy or trying to find answers to whatever questions your mind may ask...but it is about finding the place in yourself which needs no answers. --Venkat Ram Reddy on Dec 27, 2011 This is one of the excellent books i have ever read. After reading this books, I was laughing at myself for the past worries and anxieties. It gave me great insights about the important of the present moment. Though the ideas discussed in this book looks easy to follow, it is extremely difficult to bring this into practice. It gives new perception about life. I enjoy each and every moment of life now after understanding the power of now. --Gnanasekaran P on Jul 15, 2012 If you've already read many self help books and still cant decide about what's the problem you cant overcome, then this book can be one of the most influential book for you. The book totally focuses on - - living in the present - analyzing the surroundings - feeling the nonliving objects - controlling your mind to not to think too much and make mental movies - suggesting you to don't take time too seriously - forget past and quit predicting future This book might not solve your problem but will help you clean up the mess in your mind, so that you'll be able to live --Dipanshu Rajput on Apr 22, 2014",

But the thirteen chapters, each a short story in its own right, create an exquisitely observed world that is anything but sleepy. A world of Kissingeresque realpolitik enacted in boys� games on a frozen lake; of �nightcreeping� through the summer backyards of strangers; of the tabloid-fueled thrills of the Falklands War and its human toll; of the cruel, luscious Dawn Madden and her power-hungry boyfriend, Ross Wilcox; of a certain Madame Eva van Outryve de Crommelynck, an elderly bohemian emigr� who is both more and less than she appears; of Jason�s search to replace his dead grandfather�s irreplaceable smashed watch before the crime is discovered; of first cigarettes, first kisses, first Duran Duran LPs, and first deaths; of Margaret Thatcher�s recession; of Gypsies camping in the woods and the hysteria they inspire; and, even closer to home, of a slow-motion divorce in four seasons.\n\nPointed, funny, profound, left-field, elegiac, and painted with the stuff of life, Black Swan Green is David Mitchell�s most subtlest and effective achievement to date.",

Using the popular object-oriented language C++, the text incorporates the latest research and state-of-the-art applications, bringing this classic to the forefront of modern computer science education. A major strength of this text is its focus on design techniques rather than on individual algorithms. The second edition of Computer Algorithms/C++ emphasizes: Design techniques: Divide and conquer, the greedy method, dynamic programming, backtracking and branch and bound are illustrated with several examples. Each algorithm is completely analyzed. Examples: A wide range of examples provides students with the actual implementation of correct design. The latest research: A thorough treatment of probabilistic and parallel algorithms is included. Full integration of randomized algorithms: Performance with nonrandomized algorithms is thoroughly compared. Computer Algorithms/C++ is appropriate as a core text for upper- and graduate-level courses in algorithms.",

But you do. And I'm certain that you'll be glad you did' Seth Godin, bestselling author of This is Marketing The Go-Giver tells the story of an ambitious young man named Joe who yearns for success. Joe is a true go-getter, though sometimes he feels as if the harder and faster he works, the further away his goals seem to be. One day, desperate to land a key sale at the end of a bad quarter, he seeks advice from the enigmatic Pindar, a legendary consultant referred to by many devotees simply as the Chairman. Over the next week, Pindar introduces Joe to a series of successful 'go-givers' who teach him how to open himself up to the power of giving. Joe learns that changing his focus from getting to giving - putting others' interests first and continually adding value to their lives - ultimately leads to unexpected results.",

      "description": "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever observes. Found dead on the grounds of his estate with a horrifying expression on his face, Sir Charles Baskerville is suspected to have had a heart attack. But Dr. James Mortimer, Charles' friend and medical attendant, is unconvinced and suspicious. As the legend has it, the Baskerville family has been plagued by a gigantic hound since the Civil War era, and Dr. Mortimer observed footprints of a similar creature a little distance off the body. As he reaches out to Sherlock Holmes, worried about the safety of the only heir, Sir Henry Baskerville, how will Holmes unravel the mystery and save Henry from the evil fate? Gripping and iconic, The Hound of the Baskervilles is one of the finest stories ever written. It has been adapted for film and television time and again. More than a century after its first publication, the novel continues to remain a spine-chilling classic.About the AuthorAn exceptionally talented storyteller, Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in May 1859. Doyle began writing while studying at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. In 1886, he began writing A Study in Scarlet, the story which not only featured Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson for the first time, but was also the first work of detective fiction where the magnifying glass was used as an investigative tool. Sherlock Holmes, the most well-known fictional detective, has been listed with Guinness World Records as the \"most portrayed movie character\" in history. Doyle wrote numerous novels, short stories, and novellas. The Valley of Fear (1915) is his fourth and last Sherlock Holmes novel. His later works reflect his passion for spiritualism, which had started when he joined the Society of Psychical Research in 1873. Doyle died of a heart attack in July 1930. He continues to be remembered as a master storyteller and the creator of the timeless detective, Sherlock Holmes. ",

      "description": "For almost three decades, Roger Pressman's Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach has been the world's leading textbook in software engineering. The new seventh edition represents a major restructuring and update of previous editions, solidifying the book's position as the most comprehensive guide to this important subject.\nThe seventh edition of Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach has been designed to consolidate and restructure the content introduced over the past two editions of the book. The chapter structure will return to a more linear presentation of software engineering topics with a direct emphasis on the major activities that are part of a generic software process. Content will focus on widely used software engineering methods and will de-emphasize or completely eliminate discussion of secondary methods, tools and techniques. The intent is to provide a more targeted, prescriptive, and focused approach, while attempting to maintain SEPA's reputation as a comprehensive guide to software engineering.\n\nThe book will be organized in five (5) parts-Process, Modeling, Quality Management, Project Management, and Advanced Topics. The chapter count will remain at 32, unchanged from the sixth edition. However, eight new chapters have been developed and another six chapters have undergone major or moderate revisions. The remaining chapters have undergone minor edits/updates.",

      "description": "The definitive companion to the MISS MARPLE novels, short stories, films and TV appearances, now revised and updated. 'I have had a lot of experience in solving different little problems that have arisen.' Most of the 'little problems' tackled by Miss Marple occurred in the pretty rural village of St Mary Mead and came in the shape of murder, robbery and blackmail. In the 40 years of her career, she even solved cases as far afield as London and the Caribbean. But though she usually masqueraded as 'everybody's favourite great aunt', what was she really like? In this authorised biography of the world's most famous female sleuth, Anne Hart combs through the 12 novels and 20 short stories in which Miss Marple appeared, uncovering clue and amassing all the evidence to solve the most difficult case of them all - the mystery of Miss Marple. This new edition has been updated to include new information about original publication dates, newspaper and magazine serials, and up-to-date lists of TV, radio and stage adaptations (including Geraldine McEwan, Julia McKenzie, June Whitfield and Susie Blake).",

They can also be insightful and illuminating, especially when they have travelled down the generations, through the centuries, taking on and eliding new meanings with each retelling. In this genre-bending book, the first of a series, Amish and Bhavna dive into the priceless treasure trove of the ancient Indian epics, as well as the vast and complex universe of Amish�s Meluha (through his Shiva Trilogy and Ram Chandra Series), to explore some of the key concepts of Indian philosophy.\n\nWhat is the ideal interplay between thought and action, taking and giving, self-love and sacrifice? How can we tell right from wrong? What can we do to bring out the best in ourselves, and to live a life with purpose and meaning, not just one fuelled by the ego and material needs? The answers lie in these simple and wise interpretations of our favourite stories by a lovable cast of fictional characters who you�ll enjoy getting to know.",

The Importance of Being Earnest is celebrated not only for the lighthearted ingenuity of its plot, but for its inspired dialogue, rich with scintillating epigrams still savored by all who enjoy artful conversation.\nFrom the play's effervescent beginnings in Algernon Moncrieff's London flat to its hilarious denouement in the drawing room of Jack Worthing's country manor in Hertfordshire, this comic masterpiece keeps audiences breathlessly anticipating a new bon mot or a fresh twist of plot moment to moment. A selection of the Common Core State Standards Initiative.",

      "description": "Irvine Welsh delivers another grisly yet enthralling insight into the mindset of the Scottish underclass in Marabou Stork Nightmares. This bleak tale is told by Roy Strang, a jug-eared underachiever who happens to be in a coma. As he flits in and out of reality in his hospital bed, we learn about the dysfunctional Strang family--Vet, his well-intentioned dinner-lady mother, John, his violent security guard father, half-brothers Bernard and Tony, disabled brother Elgin and naive little sister Kim.\n\nGrowing up on a housing estate in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, Roy unavoidably gets into scrapes with other kids and, as his crimes eventually become more serious, the police. Welsh expertly interweaves into this base reality Roy's surreal hallucination of his time spent in South Africa with \"Sandy Jamieson\"--the fearless hunter (a figment of his troubled mind) with whom he goes in search of the vicious but elusive Marabou Stork, a beast that isn't what it seems to be. Roy trains his mind to shut out the present and finds comfort in his African escapism--anything to avoid dealing with the consequences of his actions in real life, and his mother's singing.\n\nThe Strangs move out to South Africa in the hope of making a better life for themselves and to raise their \"prospects\", but they are disillusioned when, in a country where white skin is considered superior, they still fail to achieve their desires. Back in Muirhouse Roy works his way up to systems analyst from a trainee, but in his own time gets his kicks from football hooliganism; he gets involved with a bad crowd whom he finds himself joining in the docks before long.\n\nThe exercise and abuse of power is a consistent theme throughout the book: it's depicted between the hunters and animals, nurse Patricia Devine and Roy, Roy and the family dog, uncle Gordon and Roy, Lochart Dawson and the black South Africans, rapists and their female victim. Having been abused in his early years--physically, verbally and sexually--Roy, in a comatose state, is unable to fight anymore and is rendered a victim as well as a perpetrator in his state of limbo.",

But when Girish's elder brother Chandru, who is in the US, decides to get married, Vinuta has to listen to the constant comparisons made between her and Chandru's wife, the 'Dollar Bahu', whose husband earns the valuable dollars that has brought the family its recent affluence. Vinuta slowly loses her peace of mind and health. Then Gouramma decides to visit her US-based son and daughter-in-law. Once there, she sees how liberating life can be, away from the strict norms that govern Indian middle-class life. But she also begins to understand that mere dollars cannot buy the love and respect that she gets as her due back in India. Does Gouramma forge a new relationship with Vinuta and can Vinuta forgive and forget the past?",

      "description": "In 1982, having sold his jazz bar to devote himself to writing, Murakami began running to keep fit. A year later, he'd completed a solo course from Athens to Marathon, and now, after dozens of such races, he reflects upon the influence the sport has had on his life and on his writing.\n\nEqual parts travelogue, training log and reminiscence, this revealing memoir covers his four-month preparation for the 2005 New York City Marathon and settings ranging from Tokyo's Jingu Gaien gardens, where he once shared the course with an Olympian, to the Charles River in Boston.\n\nBy turns funny and sobering, playful and philosophical, this is a must-read for fans of this masterful yet private writer as well as for the exploding population of athletes who find similar satisfaction in distance running.",

      "description": "THE #1 SUNDAY TIMES BESTSELLER NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY The Times / Guardian / Telegraph / i News / The New York Times / Washington Post / NPR / Marie Claire A riveting, deeply personal account of history in the making-from the president who inspired us to believe in the power of democracy 'Gorgeously written, humorous, compelling, life affirming' Justin Webb, Mail on Sunday In the stirring, highly anticipated first volume of his presidential memoirs, Barack Obama tells the story of his improbable odyssey from young man searching for his identity to leader of the free world, describing in strikingly personal detail both his political education and the landmark moments of the first term of his historic presidency-a time of dramatic transformation and turmoil. Obama takes readers on a compelling journey from his earliest political aspirations to the pivotal Iowa caucus victory that demonstrated the power of grassroots activism to the watershed night of November 4, 2008, when he was elected 44th president of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the nation's highest office. Reflecting on the presidency, he offers a unique and thoughtful exploration of both the awesome reach and the limits of presidential power, as well as singular insights into the dynamics of U.S. partisan politics and international diplomacy. Obama brings readers inside the Oval Office and the White House Situation Room, and to Moscow, Cairo, Beijing, and points beyond. We are privy to his thoughts as he assembles his cabinet, wrestles with a global financial crisis, takes the measure of Vladimir Putin, overcomes seemingly insurmountable odds to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act, clashes with generals about U.S. strategy in Afghanistan, tackles Wall Street reform, responds to the devastating Deepwater Horizon blowout, and authorizes Operation Neptune's Spear, which leads to the death of Osama bin Laden. A Promised Land is extraordinarily intimate and introspective-the story of one man's bet with history, the faith of a community organizer tested on the world stage. Obama is candid about the balancing act of running for office as a Black American, bearing the expectations of a generation buoyed by messages of \"hope and change,\" and meeting the moral challenges of high-stakes decision-making. He is frank about the forces that opposed him at home and abroad, open about how living in the White House affected his wife and daughters, and unafraid to reveal self-doubt and disappointment. Yet he never wavers from his belief that inside the great, ongoing American experiment, progress is always possible. This beautifully written and powerful book captures Barack Obama's conviction that democracy is not a gift from on high but something founded on empathy and common understanding and built together, day by day. 'What is unexpected in A Promised Land is the former president's candour' David Olusoga, Observer",

Karin Slaughter dazzled readers and critics alike with Triptych, her New York Times bestselling suspense novel set in metropolitan Atlanta. Now the #1 internationally bestselling author returns to the damaged landscape she knows so well in a bold new novel�at once a powder keg of suspense, a gritty portrait of a cop�s life, and a searing exploration of a shocking crime and its aftermath�\n\nWith its gracious homes and tree-lined streets, Ansley Park is one of Atlanta�s most desirable neighborhoods. But in one gleaming mansion, in a teenager�s lavish bedroom, a girl has been savagely murdered. And in the hallway, her horrified mother stands amid shattered glass, having killed her daughter�s attacker with her bare hands.\n\nDetective Will Trent of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation is here only to do a political favor; the murder site belongs to the Atlanta police. But Trent soon sees something that the cops are missing, something in the trail of blood, in a matrix of forensic evidence, and in the eyes of the shell-shocked mother. Within minutes, Trent is taking over the case�and adding another one to it. He is sure that another teenage girl is missing, and that a killer is on the loose.\n\nArmed with only fleeting clues, teamed with a female cop who has her own personal reasons for hating him, Trent has enemies all around him�and a gnawing feeling that this case, which started in the best of homes, is cutting quick and deep through the ruins of perfect lives broken wide-open: where human demons emerge with a vengeance.",

      "description": "How did it end up like this? Twenty-seven, unemployed, mistaken for a drug addict, in a treatment centre in the back arse of nowhere with an empty Valium bottle in my knickers . . .'\n\nMeet Rachel Walsh. She has a pair of size 8 feet and such a fondness for recreational drugs that her family has forked out the cash for a spell in Cloisters - Dublin's answer to the Betty Ford Clinic. She's only agreed to her incarceration because she's heard that rehab is wall-to-wall jacuzzis, gymnasiums and rock stars going tepid turkey - and it's about time she had a holiday.\n\nBut what Rachel doesn't count on are the toe-curling embarrassments heaped on her by family and group therapy, the dearth of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll - and missing Luke, her ex. What kind of a new start in life is this?",

It tells of a girl named Alice falling through a rabbit hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar, anthropomorphic creatures. The tale plays with logic, giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children. It is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre. Its narrative course and structure, characters and imagery have been enormously influential in both popular culture and literature, especially in the fantasy genre.",

Particularly the Ionian Greeks and their contention that the the Universe had to have a cause based on the laws of science.\n\nIt covers landmark discoveries, like that of Copernicus who showed that the Earth was not the center of the Universe. It explains the various laws of physics that have provided answers to so many things that have puzzled people for long. The authors show that the Theory of Relativity and Quantum Physics have together helped humans understand many of the deep mysteries about the Universe. But the quest to find a single theory, a unified theory that will explain everything about everything has been elusive.",

      "description": "Considering the importance of computer system analysis in today's modern world, it is essential that there is proper guidance in place. Computer Organisation and Design by David A Patterson and John L. Hennessy is focussed on providing detailed information about the changing world of technology and the latest updates with relation to factors like a switch from uniprocessor to multicore microprocessors. It analyses the advancements that have taken place with this parallelism and also provides some historical perspectives.\n\nModern computers need some prerequisite knowledge and a certain skill-set to be understood fully. The book says that what you need is sound fundamental know-how of the processors and the workings of a computer. Consisting of a strong mix of information relating to both hardware and software and their interface, Computer Organisation and Design is useful for those who are novices when it comes to computer design or are used to working with either hardware or software only and want to understand the other. Database programmers, software engineers and operating system designers will be able to utilise the information presented in the text to understand the concepts of the subject.\n\nMIPS processor, computer language, arithmetic for computers, microprogramming, recent pentium implementation, pipelining, input output performance measures, the basics and implementation of cache performance and logic design are some of the topics covered under this title. New and promising inventions like the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) have been explained in the text as well.",

      "description": "April 1950: The rusting hulk of a steam locomotive rises from the deep waters of a Montana lake. Inside is all that remains of three men who died forty-four years before. But it is not the engine or its grisly contents that interest the people watching nearby. It is what is about to come next . . .\n\n1906: For twelve years, the western states of America have been suffering an extraordinary crime spree: a string of bank robberies by a single man who cold-bloodedly murders any and all witnesses and then vanishes without a trace. Fed up by the depredations of the \"Butcher Bandit,\" the U.S. government brings in the best man they can find-a tall, lean, no-nonsense detective named Isaac Bell, who has caught thieves and killers coast to coast.\n\nBut Bell has never had a challenge like this one. From Arizona to Colorado to the streets of San Francisco during its calamitous earthquake and fire, he pursues what is quickly becoming clear to him is the sharpest criminal mind he has ever encountered, and the woman who seems to hold the key to the bandit's identity. Using science, deduction, and intuition, Bell repeatedly draws near only to grasp at thin air, but at least he knows his pursuit is having an effect. Because his quarry is getting angry now, and has turned the chase back on him. The hunter has become the hunted. And soon it will take all of Isaac Bell's skills not merely to prevail� but to survive",

      "description": "he Old Man And His God is a collection of short stories by Sudha Murthy based on her own experiences as she encounters many different kinds of people in the course of her work.\n\nSummary Of The Book\n\nIn the introduction to The Old Man And His God, the author says that she is often asked how such interesting incidents happen to her. Her answer is that these are ordinary incidents and encounters that occur in the life of everyone. It is just that many people do not observe and record them.\n\nThe book contains stories that hold up a mirror to every characteristic of humanity, generosity, selfishness, greed, contentment, and ambition. These are tales of people�s behavior and reactions in ordinary circumstances and during crisis.\n\nShe tells the story of a banyan tree in a remote village in Karnataka that gives shelter to travelers under its shade, and of the man who sits on a stone under the tree and lets passersby share the seat and their troubles with him, acting as a counselor to them, letting them unburden their worries on him for a while.\n\nThere are stories of women trying to make a difference in the community against odds, of acts of selfishness and generosity in times of disaster, of young professionals and the attitudes that make some of them succeed in the corporate race.",

Doyle transmogrified the legend: generations ago, a hound of hell tore out the throat of devilish Hugo Baskerville on the moonlit moor. Poor, accursed Baskerville Hall now has another mysterious death: that of Sir Charles Baskerville. Could the culprit somehow be mixed up with secretive servant Barrymore, history-obsessed Dr. Frankland, butterfly-chasing Stapleton, or Selden, the Notting Hill murderer at large? Someone's been signaling with candles from the mansion's windows. Nor can supernatural forces be ruled out. Can Dr. Watson--left alone by Sherlock Holmes to sleuth in fear for much of the novel--save the next Baskerville, Sir Henry, from the hound's fangs?",

Coined by author and professor Cal Newport on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you better at what you do, let you achieve more in less time and provide the sense of true fulfilment that comes from the mastery of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive economy. And yet most people, whether knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creatives struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and social media, not even realising there's a better way. A mix of cultural criticism and actionable advice, DEEP WORK takes the reader on a journey through memorable stories -- from Carl Jung building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most serious professionals should quit social media and that you should practice being bored. Put simply: developing and cultivating a deep work practice is one of the best decisions you can make in an increasingly distracted world and this book will point the way.",

      "description": "Each person is different, not just in their physical appearance, but in their behavior, attitude, skills, success level and other points. However, many people share similar backgrounds, knowledge, qualifications, and skills. Yet, only some of them manage to use their skills and knowledge effectively to build a good life for themselves.\n\nIf people with similar backgrounds and talent are not all uniformly successful, what made the difference? This is the question Mindset: How You Can Fulfil Your Potential discusses in detail. The author shows that it is not just talent and knowledge that forms the ingredients for success, there is one other vital factor, the person�s mindset.\n\nThe author identifies two different mindsets, the fixed mindset and the growth mindset. People with a fixed mindset view the skills and capabilities they possess as something engraved in stone, something fixed that they take for granted. These people also believe that their talent and gifts assure them success, without much effort. They spend their life measuring their performance and success levels. If they encounter setbacks, they view themselves as failures, and as being inadequate.",

      "description": "A comic masterpiece that has never been out of print since it was first published in 1889, Jerome K. Jerome's Three Men in a Boat includes an introduction and notes by Jeremy Lewis in Penguin Classics. Martyrs to hypochondria and general seediness, J. and his friends George and Harris decide that a jaunt up the Thames would suit them to a 'T'. But when they set off, they can hardly predict the troubles that lie ahead with tow-ropes, unreliable weather forecasts and tins of pineapple chunks - not to mention the devastation left in the wake of J.'s small fox-terrier Montmorency. Three Men in a Boat was an instant success when it appeared in 1889, and, with its benign escapism, authorial discursions and wonderful evocation of the late-Victorian 'clerking classes', it hilariously captured the spirit of its age. In his introduction, Jeremy Lewis examines Jerome K. Jerome's life and times, and the changing world of Victorian England he depicts - from the rise of a new mass-culture of tabloids and bestselling novels to crazes for daytripping and bicycling. Jerome K. Jerome (1859-1927) was born in Walstall, Staffordshire, and educated at Marylebone Grammar School. He left school at fourteen to become a railway clerk, the first in a long line of jobs that included actor, teacher and journalist. His first book, On Stage and Off, a collection of humorous pieces about the theatre, was published in 1885, and was followed the year after with the more commercially-successful The Idle Thoughts of an Idle Fellow; but it was with Three Men in a Boat (1889) that Jerome achieved lasting fame. He later went on to become one of the founders of the humorous magazine, The Idler, and continued to write articles and plays. If you enjoyed Three Men in a Boat, you might like Stella Gibbons's Cold Comfort Farm, also available in Penguin Classics.",

      "description": "1867, Canada: as winter tightens its grip on the isolated settlement of Dove River, a man is brutally murdered and a 17-year old boy disappears. Tracks leaving the dead man's cabin head north towards the forest and the tundra beyond. In the wake of such violence, people are drawn to the township - journalists, Hudson's Bay Company men, trappers, traders - but do they want to solve the crime, or exploit it? One-by-one the assembled searchers set out from Dove River, pursuing the tracks across a desolate landscape home only to wild animals, madmen and fugitives, variously seeking a murderer, a son, two sisters missing for 17 years, a forgotten Native American culture, and a fortune in stolen furs before the snows settle and cover the tracks of the past for good. In an astonishingly assured debut, Stef Penney deftly weaves adventure, suspense, revelation and humour into a panoramic historical romance, an exhilarating thriller, a keen murder mystery and ultimately, with the sheer scope and quality of her storytelling, one of the books of the year.",

      "description": "From the Sunday Times and ebook bestselling author of A Wartime Christmas comes a gritty and nostlagic family saga about love, loss and keeping family together.\n\n'Surely one of the best saga writers of her time' � Rosie Clarke\n\n1940. Molly Swift, at 27, has already suffered the tragic loss of her two-year-old daughter Emily to the flu outbreak of 1935. Now she waits for news of her shopkeeper husband Ted, who volunteered for the British Expeditionary Forces at the outbreak of war.\n\nMolly is intent on running the general store with the help of her retired father, Bill Keen, the ex-proprietor of the business. But after the building is hit during a bombing raid and Bill is severly injured, Molly faces difficult times. Alone in the hospital corridor as Bill is treated, Molly tries to keep positive. But the Blitz is well underway and she is forced to take shelter in the hospital�s basement. It�s here, as the bombs fall around docklands, that Molly meets Andy Miller and his two young children, Evie and Mark. An unlikely friendship begins as Molly offers the homeless group safe lodgings for the following night, and soon their lives are entwined, bringing unexpected joy and heartache for them all.\n\nPraise for CAROL RIVERS:\n\n'A gripping page turner' - LEAH FLEMING\n\n'Brings the East End to life - family loyalties, warring characters and broken dreams. Superb' - ELIZABETH GILL",

      "description": "With her final novel, Villette, Charlotte Bront� reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, Villette is Bront�'s most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even Jane Eyre in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquette. The first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey - a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature.",
